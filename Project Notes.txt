Base Construction Notes:
The car as shown in the video is 30.5 inches wide, and it's front to back members are 17.0 inches long. 
Most of the frame uses 1x3 stock. 
But the motors, and the inner barrier (that run that separates the batteries from the electronics on the underside) is made from 1x2 stock.  
These dimensions are not critical, but once you pick a length, then you'll want to get all the similar pieces to be as close to that length as possible.    
BTW: You can cut this aluminum with circular saw (using a blade that can be had from Home Depot/ Lows).
And by using the various brackets, they make for this material, the finished frame will be quite rigid. 
However, on the down side, buying all these special bolts & brackets can get pretty pricey.
